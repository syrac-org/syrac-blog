# Introducing official tasks

The 2026 season starts with a challenge.

We've invited some of paragliding's major brands to design official tasks on Syrac.
These tasks are suitable for pilots of all experience levels, whether you're aiming for the top of the leaderboards or just want to have fun.

Welcome to the manufacturers league, which will run until December 31st, 2026.
No entry fee. Everyone's invited.

## Advance (TBC)

## Ascendant (TBC)

## Nervures

**One valley, two variants.** [Nervures](https://www.nervures.com/) joins the manufacturers league with a [winter](https://app.syrac.org/task/b3886354-e739-426e-b365-8e4216afc261) and a [summer](https://app.syrac.org/task/dfa7ef8b-4c45-4bcb-b3bd-9e14681fbf99) task near their workshop in the Hautes-Pyrénees.

TODO Add task screenshots.

## Niviuk (TBC)

## Ozone

**Where the fast kids play.** [Ozone](https://flyozone.com/) didn't mess around. Their [Gourdon task](https://app.syrac.org/task/7b2fe0d3-882d-43d3-a779-1ddffc5691af) runs straight through their R&D testing grounds—the same place where they push their wings to the limit. Speed's the name of the game here. Can you keep up?

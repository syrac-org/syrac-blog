# Introducing official tasks

The 2026 season starts with a challenge.

We've invited some of paragliding's major brands to design official tasks on Syrac.
Whether you’re chasing the top of the leaderboard or just flying for fun, these tasks are open to everyone.

Welcome to the manufacturers league, which will run until February 1st, 2027.
No entry fee. Everyone's invited.

## Nervures

**One valley, two variants.** [Nervures](https://www.nervures.com/) joins the manufacturers league with a [winter](https://app.syrac.org/task/b3886354-e739-426e-b365-8e4216afc261) and a [summer](https://app.syrac.org/task/dfa7ef8b-4c45-4bcb-b3bd-9e14681fbf99) task near their workshop in the Hautes-Pyrénees.

TODO Add task screenshots.

## Niviuk

## Ozone

**Where the fast kids play.** [Ozone](https://flyozone.com/) didn't mess around. Their two [Gourdon](https://app.syrac.org/task/7b2fe0d3-882d-43d3-a779-1ddffc5691af) [tasks](https://app.syrac.org/task/cc444183-4942-41e9-9735-5b3bbcc91d2a) run straight through their R&D testing grounds—the same place where they push their wings to the limit. Speed's the name of the game here. Can you keep up?

## Task editor

Create and edit tasks easily using [Syrac's new built-in task editor](https://app.syrac.org/task/editor).
You can create and edit tasks without a waypoint file, and the editor works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## User profiles

See your own and your friends' achievements by checking their profile pages.

Profiles include basic user stats:

- number of tasks created
- number of tasks completed
- number of overall completions on created tasks ("reach")

as well as a feed of recent activities.

## Social media sharing

You can now more easily share your task completions on social media using a transparent image, which can be copied from your profile.

## Leaderboard improvements


### Track signature validation

To encourage transparency, task leaderboards now include an icon indicating whether the track signature is valid.
This doesn't prevent all forms of cheating, but it discourages pilots from manually modifying their tracks.

### Multiple completions

Next to the track signature icon, another badge indicates the number of completions for pilots who have completed the task more than once.

### Glider models

Leaderboards now include the glider model, which needs to be declared when submitting a track.

### Category filter

Leaderboards can now be filtered by category, enabling clubs to create Sport and Serial rankings if they wish.

## Help dialogs

The task editor and task details pages now include help dialogs to guide users through creating and completing tasks.

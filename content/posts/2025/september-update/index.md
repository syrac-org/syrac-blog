## Task editor

Create and edit tasks easily using [Syrac's new built-in task editor](https://app.syrac.org/task/editor).
It supports creating and editing tasks without requiring a waypoint file, and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## User profiles

See your and your friends achievements by checking their profile page.

Profiles include basic user stats:

- number of tasks created
- number of tasks completed
- number of overall completions on created tasks ("reach")

as well as a feed of latest activities.

## Social media sharing

You can now more easily share your tasks completions on social media using a transparent image, which can be copied from your profile.

## Leaderboard improvements


### Track signature validation

To encourage transparency, task leaderboards now include an icon indicating whether the track signature is valid.
This does not prevent all forms of cheating, but at least dissuades pilots from manually modifying their tracks.

### Multiple completions

Next to the track signature icon, another badge indicates the number of completions for pilots having completed the task more than once.

### Glider models

Leaderboards now include the glider model, which needs to be declared when submitting a track.

### Category filter

Finally, leaderboards can be filtered by category, enabling clubs to create Sport and Serial rankings if they wish to.

## Help dialogs

The task editor and task details pages now include help dialogs to guide users through creating and completing tasks.
